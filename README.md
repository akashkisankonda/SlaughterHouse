## Introduction

Welcome to **PointNShoot**, a football game prototype developed by **Xansr Technologies**. This private project is currently under development, and we're excited to provide you with a sneak peek into our world of gaming.

## Features

- **Engaging Football Gameplay:** PointNShoot offers an immersive gaming experience, combining elements of strategy and action, even if it's not entirely realistic.

- **Two Teams:** The game features two teams â€“ "Player" and "Opponent." Engage in thrilling matches with AI-driven opponents in this private project.

- **Player vs. AI:** In PointNShoot, each player is paired with an AI-driven opponent, providing an opportunity to test your skills against intelligent adversaries.

- **Ball Handling:** Master the art of ball handling. When a player possesses the ball, the associated opponent will make efforts to snatch it, and vice versa.

- **Goal Scoring:** When an opponent has the ball, they'll make a dash for the goal. As a player, your objective is to defend your goal from their attempts.

- **AI Decisions:** Opponent AI makes strategic decisions based on various parameters set within the game.

- **Goalkeeper Protection:** The player's goalkeeper steps in to prevent opponents from scoring when the action is near the player's goal post.

- **Passing Mechanism:** If you have the ball, you can pass it to another player by aiming the reticle accordingly, enhancing the team dynamic.

- **Ball Physics:** The game features authentic ball physics, delivering an enjoyable gaming experience with realistic ball behavior.

- **Game Restart:** Hitting the goal post boundary results in a game restart, providing a fresh chance for both teams.

- **Default Player:** By default, one player has the ball, setting the stage for exciting matches and strategic gameplay.
